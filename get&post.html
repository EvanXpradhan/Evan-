<h1 style="background-color:rgb(179, 220, 149);"><center>GET</center></h1>

<ol>
  <li>When using GET, data parameters are included in the URL and visible to everyone.</li>
  <li>GET is less secure because the URL contains part of the data sent.</li>
  <li>GET requests can be cached and remain in the browser history, </li>
  <li>GET requests are intended to retrieve data from a server and do not modify the server’s state. </li>
  <li>The GET method is limited to a maximum number of characters, while the POST method has no such limitation. This is because the GET method sends data through the resource URL, which is limited in length.</li>
 </ol>
 
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(179, 220, 149);"><center>POST<center></h1>
 <ol>
  <li>when using POST, data is not displayed in the URL but in the HTTP message body.</li>
  <li>POST is safer because the parameters are not stored in web server logs or the browser history.</li>
  <li>This means GET requests can be bookmarked, shared, and revisited, while POST requests cannot</li>
  <li>POST requests are used to send data to the server for processing and may modify the server’s state.</li>
  <li>the POST method sends data through the HTTP message body, which has no such limitation.</li>\
